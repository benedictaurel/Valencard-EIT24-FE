## What we used
This is our front-end repository. Here, we blended Node.js, Vite.js, React.js, and TailwindCSS, spiced up with a variety of front-end libraries to look it cool mwehwehw

On the back-end part, we have Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL as our main database. And if you dont like Postgres then dont worry, we made another version for SQLite! Plus, the database is hooked to Vercel's serverless storage for smooth query.

If you want to view the the back-end repository, check it out [here](https://github.com/javendzk/Valencard-EIT24-BE). Lastly, both our front-end and backend are also hosted by Vercel for free. Thank you Vercel!
